<p><h2> This is a random webpage made for an interesting course in my local university. The website will be dedicated to French Bulldogs, because why not? In addition - they offer great companion and cheer up everyone's day.</h2></p>

<p><h3> Here are some random facts of those funny dogs:-</h3>
<br>
- <font color="blue"><b>French Bulldogs are actually from England - wait, what?</b></font><br>
<br>
It is true. They were first bred in 1800s by lace makers who wanted to breed small, miniature version of the English Bulldog. In the 1860s when craftsmen moved to France, they brought their “toy” Bulldogs along. They became very popular there and were given the name French Bulldogs.<br>
<br>
- <font color="blue"><b>They can't swim.</b></font><br>
The reasos is because of their heaviness and pushed in noses. That is why they sink very easyily and have trouble keeping their noses above the water.
